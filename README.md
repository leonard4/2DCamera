2D Camera
==========

This was an exercise to setup a camera to follow an object when it approaches the edge of the screen and have the camera follow that object as it "pushes" up against the edge.

How it works
------------
When the player object is within 0.1 units of any edge of the screen, the camera will stick with the player in that direction.
